```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        {/* ...other routes */}
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```
This code uses `react-router-dom` v6.  If you use a relative path in a `<Link>` component that's nested deeply within a component hierarchy, the path might resolve incorrectly, leading to unexpected navigation behavior.  For example, if you have nested routes and try to navigate to a sibling route relative to the current route, it might not work as expected. 

Consider this scenario:

```javascript
// Parent component
<Route path='/parent'>
    <Route path='/' element={<ParentComponent/>} />
    <Route path='child1' element={<ChildComponent1/>} />
    <Route path='child2' element={<ChildComponent2/>} />
</Route>
```

If you are in `ChildComponent1` and attempt to navigate to `child2` with a relative path such as `../child2`, it might resolve the path incorrectly, not going to `child2`, because the relative path is relative to the root path of the application, not the parent component.
